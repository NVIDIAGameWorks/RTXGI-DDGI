# RTX Global Illumination

Version 1.3

## Contents

This repository branch contains the RTXGI SDK - and only the SDK - so it can be included as a submodule in other projects while adding only the required files.

* [rtxgi-sdk/include](include) contains the include files for host code and (some) shaders

* [rtxgi-sdk/src](src) contains the host source code and some useful utilities

* [rtxgi-sdk/shaders](shaders) contains the HLSL shader code to be compiled with the [DirectX Shader Compiler (DXC)](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler)

For the complete RTXGI SDK distribution, including samples and documentation, switch to the main branch.
