Quick Start
============

This fastest way to start learning RTXGI is to build and run the Test Harness sample application that is provided with the SDK distribution. To do this, you'll first need to meet the following software and hardware requirements:

.. raw:: html

   <b>Software:</b> <br>

* Windows 10 v1809 or higher
* Visual Studio 2017 or 2019
* Windows SDK version 10.0.17763 or higher (can be installed using the Visual Studio Installer)
* CMake 3.14.5 or higher, `download here. <https://cmake.org/download>`_
* The latest drivers for your GPU. NVIDIA drivers `are available here. <http://www.nvidia.com/drivers>`_

.. raw:: html

   <b>Hardware:</b> <br>

* Any DXR enabled GPU. NVIDIA DXR enabled GPUs:

    * RTX 3090, 3080, 3070, 3060 Ti, 3060
    * RTX 2080 Ti, 2080 SUPER, 2080, 2070 SUPER, 2070, 2060 SUPER, 2060
    * GTX 1660 Ti, 1660 SUPER, 1660
    * GTX 1080 Ti, 1080, 1070, 1060 with at least 6GB of memory

-------------------------------
Generating Projects with CMake
-------------------------------

After downloading the SDK package, you will need to generate the appropriate Visual Studio project using `CMake <http://cmake.org>`_ to build and run the code.

**Test Harness Sample Application and SDK:**

1. Open CMake
2. On the *source code* line, fill in the path to the SDK package plus */samples*
3. On the *build binaries* line, use the path on the *source code* line plus */build*

   |cmake_image-1|

4. Select **Configure**

   a. If using VS2017, you must select **x64** as the platform for the generator in the dropdown
   b. If using VS2019, the platform is x64 by default

5. Select **Generate**
6. The generated Visual Studio project will be found at *samples/build/RTXGISamples.sln*

**SDK Only:**

If you want to build only the RTXGI SDK, and aren't interested in samples, follow these steps:

1. Open CMake
2. On the *source code* line, fill in the path to the SDK package plus */rtxgi-sdk*
3. On the *build binaries* line, use the path on the *source code* line plus */build*
4. Select **Configure**

   a. If using VS2017, you must select **x64** as the platform for generator in the dropdown 
   b. If using VS2019, the platform is x64 by default

   |cmake_image-2|

5. Select **Generate**
6. The generated Visual Studio project will be found at *rtxgi-sdk/build/RTXGI.sln*

---------------------------
Running the Test Harness
---------------------------

To run the Test Harness sample application, open the generated *RTXGISamples.sln* Visual Studio solution file. The application requires an initialization file be passed as the first argument on the command line. CMake adds this command line argument automatically to the Debug Solution Configuration (shown below). 

|testharness-vs-cmdline|

Change the Solution Configuration to Debug and run the application. 

.. note:: To learn more about the sample application, head over to the :ref:`Harness` page.
