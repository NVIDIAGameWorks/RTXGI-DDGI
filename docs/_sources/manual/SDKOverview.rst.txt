RTXGI SDK Overview
===================

The core of the RTXGI SDK is designed as a container for a number of different global illumination algorithms. With this first release of the SDK, we introduce our implementation of the *Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination (DDGI)* algorithm, `first described in an academic publication from NVIDIA Research <http://jcgt.org/published/0008/02/01/>`_  along with collaborators at McGill University and the University of Montreal. In addition, the core SDK includes several helpful basic types, enumerations, defines, macros, math operations, and psuedo random number utilities.

---------------------------------------------------
Versioning
---------------------------------------------------

``rtxgi-sdk/include/Common.h`` contains the ``RTXGI_VERSION`` struct, which defines the current version of the SDK. Applications can check the SDK version using either the static ``major``, ``minor``, and ``revision`` values or by comparing against the result of ``getVersionString()``. 

This documentation is for version 1.00.00 of the SDK.

---------------------------------------------------
Types
---------------------------------------------------

``rtxgi-sdk/include/Types.h`` defines several common vector types used by the RTXGI SDK host side code. The following table describes these types:

.. list-table:: RTXGI SDK Vector Types
   :widths: 1 5
   :align: left
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Type
     - Description
   * - ``uint2``, ``uint3``, ``uint4``
     - A vector of two, three, or four 32-bit ``unsigned int`` values
   * - ``int2``, ``int3``, ``int4``
     - A vector of two, three, or four 32-bit ``int`` values
   * - ``float2``, ``float3``, ``float4``
     - A vector of two, three, or four 32-bit ``float`` values
   * - ``float4x4``
     - A vector of four ``float4`` values, representing a each row of a 4x4 matrix
   * - ``AABB``
     - A vector of two ``float3`` values, representing the minimum and maximum world space positions of an axis aligned bounding box

---------------------------------------------------
Enumerations
---------------------------------------------------

``rtxgi-sdk/include/Common.h`` consists of enumerations, structs, and macros for use in host side code.

Many of the public host side functions available in RTXGI return status codes to indicate the result of their execution. The ``ERTXGIStatus`` enumeration is used to communicate that status. The status codes of the enumeration are described in the following tables:

.. list-table:: ERTXGIStatus Codes
   :widths: 1 5
   :align: left
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Code
     - Description
   * - ``OK``
     - Execution completed successfully
   * - ``ERROR_DDGI_INVALID_PROBE_COUNTS``
     - An invalid number of probes was supplied in :ref:`DDGIVolumeDesc <DDGI-DescribeVolume>`
   * - ``ERROR_DDGI_INVALID_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR_HEAP``

   * - ``ERROR_DDGI_MAP_FAILURE_CONSTANT_BUFFER``
     - The constant buffer supplied in :ref:`DDGIVolumeDesc <DDGI-DescribeVolume>` wasn't able to be mapped. This typically indicates an invalid constant buffer pointer.

---------------------------------------------------

``rtxgi-sdk/shaders/Common.hlsl`` defines some basic helper functions.
